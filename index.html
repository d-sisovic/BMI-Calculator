        <h1>Body Mass Index Calculator</h1>

        <p>
            Better understand your weight in relation to your height using our body mass index (BM) calculator. While
            BMI
            is not the sole determinant of a healthy weight, it offers a valuable starting point to evaluate your
            overall health and well-being.

        <h1>What your BMI result means</h1>

        <p>A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.' Maintaining a healthy weight may lower your
            chances of experiencing health issues later on, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim for a nutritious
            diet with reduced fat and sugar content, incorporating ample fruits and vegetables. Additionally, strive for
            regular physical activity, ideally about 30 minutes daily for five days a week.

        <h1>Limitations of BMI</h1>

        <p>Although BMI is often a practical indicator of healthy weight, it is not suited for every person. Specific
            groups should carefully consider their BMI outcomes, and in certain cases, the measurement may not be
            beneficial to use
        </p>

            </div>

            <p>
                The development and body fat composition of girls and boys vary with age. Consequently, a child's age
                and
                gender are considered when evaluating their BMI.

            </div>

            <p>
                In aging individuals, increased body fat and muscle loss may cause BMI to underestimate body fat
                content.

                <h3>Muscle</h3>
            </div>

            <p>
                BMI may misclassify muscular individuals as overweight or obese, as it doesn't differentiate muscle from
                fat.

            <p>
                Expectant mothers experience weight gain due to their growing baby. Maintaining a healthy pre-pregnancy
                BMI is advisable to minimise health risks for both mother and child.

                Certain health concerns may affect individuals of some Black and Asian origins at lower BMIs than
                others. To learn more, it is advised to discuss this with your GP or practice nurse.
